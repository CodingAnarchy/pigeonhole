# 0117: static partitions across `phdb serve` nodes (the partition map, `Cluster.*`, the cluster scope)

**Status:** Approved. The number is from the coordinator. The design is D317 ([#1482](https://github.com/CodingAnarchy/pigeonhole/issues/1482#issuecomment-6637596392), revision 2): perf287's and cli692's reviews are folded in, and the owner signed it off on 2026-11-04. cli692 agreed to ticket 1's serve shapes, and the coordinator chose the `SetMap` error code (2026-11-09). This file grows with D317's tickets. Ticket 1 is below; later tickets add their sections.

## Ticket 1: the partition map

**proto (`proto/pigeonhole/v1/cluster.proto`, additive in v1):**
- `ClusterMap { cluster_id, map_version, nodes, partitions, tables }`, `Node`, `Partition { id, node, epoch }`, `TablePlacement { name, group, families, splits, partitions }` and `SplitKey { oneof key { text, raw } }`.
- **Split keys:** they compare as their bytes, so the `text` and `raw` forms of one key are one key. The canonical form prints `text` when the bytes are UTF-8.
- The `Cluster` service: `GetMap`, `SetMap`, `PushMap` and `Status`.

**What a valid map is:**
- **Ids:** `cluster_id`, node ids and partition ids are `[a-z0-9_-]`, 1–64 characters, not starting with `-`. A partition id is also its file's name.
- **Versions and epochs:** `map_version` and every epoch are at least 1.
- **References:** every partition's node is listed, and every placement's partitions are listed.
- **Placements:**
  - names are unique, and none starts with `__phdb_`;
  - split keys are non-empty, distinct and increasing;
  - `partitions.len() == splits.len() + 1`;
  - families are valid `FamilySpec`s;
  - a co-location group's tables are unsplit, on one partition.
- **Plaintext clusters:** on a node without TLS (`--insecure-no-tls-no-auth`, or tokens on a loopback listener), every node address must resolve to loopback, since the node would send its cluster token to them in the clear.

**What a change may do:** these rules apply one step at a time, where a map is set (`SetMap`, against the node's current map). A node taking a map from a peer (`PushMap`, a pull, catching up at start) checks only that it's valid, of the same `cluster_id`, and newer. It may have missed several steps, and the rules don't hold across a jump: a table dropped and created again with other splits, or a partition dropped and added back at a lower epoch.
- The same `cluster_id` and a greater `map_version`.
- Existing placements keep their split keys (compared as bytes), partitions and group. Moving ranges is #1499.
- A partition that holds a placement isn't dropped.
- A partition's epoch never falls, and its node changes only with a greater epoch.

**`phdb serve --cluster DIR --node-id ID`:**
- **It replaces the positional `FILE`.**
  - `DIR/cluster-map.json` holds the node's newest map: canonical proto3 JSON, written temp → fsync → rename → directory fsync.
  - `DIR/<partition>.phdb` are the partition files.
  - `DIR/.lock` is held exclusively while the server runs, and `phdb cluster init-partition` takes it too.
- **Refused with `--cluster` at startup, until a later D317 ticket defines them:** `--replica-of`, `--memory` and `--create`.
- **Ticket 1 serves no data in cluster mode:** routing is ticket 2. The node runs the `Cluster` service and health.
- **Flags:**
  - `--cluster-token-file FILE`: the token this node presents to its peers.
  - `--cluster-push-timeout-ms` (default 2000): each push's bound.

**The `cluster` token scope:**
- **A fourth scope outside the `read < write < admin` chain.** An admin token isn't a cluster token, and the reverse holds too.
- **Where it's accepted:** `Cluster.PushMap` (only there), plus `Cluster.GetMap` and `Cluster.Status`. Later tickets add the node-to-node forwards.
- **Token file line:** `<token> cluster`.
- **Rotation:** list the old and new cluster tokens on every node, then switch each node's `--cluster-token-file`.

**The `Cluster` service:**

| RPC | Scope | HTTP | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GetMap` | read, admin, cluster | `GET /v1/cluster/map` | The node's newest map (`NotFound` before it has one). |
| `SetMap` | admin | `POST /v1/cluster/map` | See below. |
| `PushMap` | cluster | gRPC only | Node to node, see below. |
| `Status` | read, admin, cluster | `GET /v1/cluster/status` | The node's id, map version, `cluster_id`, partition files (relative names) with their identity rows, and `divergent` peers. |

**`SetMap`:**
- **First map:** a node's first map takes `expected_map_version = 0`, and must name the node it's sent to.
- **Steps:** it validates (and validates the change from the current map), persists, and pushes to every other node in parallel, each push within `--cluster-push-timeout-ms`.
- **The answer:** sent once the map is persisted here, with each push's result. A node the push missed pulls the map later (below).

**`PushMap`:**
- **Accepted:** a valid map with a greater version and the same cluster (the change rules were checked where it was set).
- **The same version with the same canonical JSON** is a no-op answering ok.
- **The same version with different content** is divergent. It's refused, and both nodes report it in `Status.divergent` until a newer map is set.

**Pull:**
- **Who triggers it:** a call from a `cluster`-scope caller that carries `x-pigeonhole-map-version` greater than the node's own, with `x-pigeonhole-node-id`.
- **What it does:** the node fetches `GetMap` from that node's address in its current map, once per version, in the background. It takes the result only through `PushMap`'s checks.
- **Other callers:** the headers are ignored.

**Errors (no new server codes):**
- **`Conflict`** (`ABORTED`, HTTP 409, not applied, retry from `Begin`): `SetMap`'s `expected_map_version` isn't the node's version. Re-read the map and try again; the message carries the node's current `map_version`.
- **`InvalidArgument`:**
  - a map that fails validation;
  - a change the map may not make;
  - a map of another cluster;
  - a pushed map not newer than the node's own;
  - a divergent map;
  - a first map that doesn't name the node;
  - a `__phdb_` table name in any schema call.
- **`NotFound`:** `GetMap` on a node with no map.
- **`PermissionDenied`:** the wrong scope (as today).

**The reserved prefix `__phdb_`:**
- **The identity row:** `phdb cluster init-partition FILE --cluster-id C --partition P [--epoch E]` (offline; it honours `DIR/.lock`) creates `__phdb_cluster` with one row: `cluster_id`, `partition_id` and `epoch`. It refuses a file whose row names another cluster or partition.
- **Hidden:** `Schema.ListTables` hides `__phdb_` tables, and every schema call refuses the prefix.
- **Excluded from user feeds:** a user `Feed.Subscribe` of every table excludes them.
- **Kept everywhere else:** backups, bootstrap copies and replication keep them, so a copy still says what it is.

**`phdb cluster` (operator commands):**
- `init-partition`, as above.
- `set-map FILE --node ADDR`: `SetMap` with the node's current version, read first.
- `show-map (--node ADDR | --file PATH)`: reads a live node or a down node's map file.
- `status --node ADDR`: `Status` on every node in the map, with their versions side by side.

## Callers changed
None yet: ticket 1 adds a mode, a service and a scope, and changes nothing a single-node server answers, except that `__phdb_` table names are refused and hidden.
